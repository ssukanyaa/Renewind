# 🌬️ ReneWind – Predictive Maintenance for Wind Turbines

This project applies classification models to predict **equipment failures** in wind turbines, enabling preemptive repairs and reducing maintenance costs.

## 🧠 Objective
Use machine learning to identify whether a wind turbine component is likely to fail, allowing predictive maintenance and minimizing downtime.
